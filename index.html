					<h1>Kyle Reynolds</h1>
					<p>As a self-taught Full Stack Software Engineer, I blend a strong background in Python and software testing with front-end development expertise. My educational journey, starting with a Liberal Studies degree from Montana State University, instilled in me a knack for analytical thinking and innovation. My career path, highlighted by roles at Figure and Bridger Photonics Inc., showcases my proficiency in developing complete software solutions.

						My passion for coding is paralleled only by my love for skateboarding, a sport I grew up with. Skateboarding taught me perseverance and resilience; it's a world where failure is a stepping stone to success. Each fall and every successful trick after numerous attempts have ingrained in me a philosophy that resonates deeply in my software development: falling in love with the process guarantees success.
						
						I am deeply committed to open-source projects, as seen in my GitHub portfolio, where I contribute to Python-based web applications. My customer service experience further enriches my ability to
						
						understand and fulfill user needs, ensuring the development of user-centric software.
						
						In my spare time, I manage instant replay for basketball games at Montana State University, a role demanding quick decision-making and problem-solving, mirroring the challenges in software development.
						
						My journey from a skateboarder to a Full Stack Software Engineer epitomizes my belief in the power of persistence and embracing the process. Let's connect to drive innovation in the tech world.</p>
